## SOLID Principles

Summary of SOLID Principles

**Single Responsibility Principle:**
- A class should only have one reason to change
- *Separation of concerns* - different classes handling different, independent tasks/problems
 
**Open-Closed Principle:**
- Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification
 
**Liskov Substitution Principle:**
- You should be able to substitute a base type for a subtype
 
**Interface Segregation Principle:**
- Don't put too much into an interface; split into seperate interfaces
- *YAGNI* - You Ain't Going to Need It

**Dependency Inversion Principle:**
- High-level modules should not depend upon low-level ones; use abstractions
